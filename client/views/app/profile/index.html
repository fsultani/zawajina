      <h5>About me</h5>
      <p>
        The best way to get to know me is by engaging me in a conversation. I
        love talking about deen, knowledge, education, and the likes. I also
        love learning, and figuring out how things work. I think it's fun to
        break something, and then figure out how to put it back together. I also
        think we should never stop improving ourselves. Learning is a never
        ending trip, and is a concept that's heavily emphasized in Islam. As our
        Prophet (pbuh) said, “Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave.”
